## About Me

I’m **Oluwaseun Fowotade**, a passionate statistician and data scientist dedicated to uncovering meaningful insights from data. With over five years of experience in data analysis, statistical modeling, and clinical programming, I thrive in solving complex problems that drive decision-making.

I specialize in **SAS programming and health analytics**, utilizing SAS, R, SQL, and Python to extract valuable insights and transform large datasets. My background includes survival analysis, predictive modeling, and developing scalable solutions for regulatory-compliant clinical research.

Beyond technical skills, I believe that data should tell a story—one that is clear, impactful, and actionable. Outside work, **I love playing and watching soccer**, enjoying both the strategy on the field and the analytics behind player performance and game tactics.

- **Graduate Teaching Assistant – Oregon State University**
  - Evaluated and graded student assignments, quizzes, and exams.
  - Led recitation sessions and review classes, simplifying complex statistical topics.
  - Taught R Programming and SAS for statistical analysis, covering techniques such as regression analysis, survival models, and time series analysis.

- **Statistical Programmer – ClinFocus Inc.**
  - Developed and maintained documentation for data management processes.
  - Performed SDTM, ADaM, and TFL Programming using SAS, ensuring compliance with CDISC and FDA submission requirements.
  - Collaborated with biostatisticians and data managers to identify data issues and resolve discrepancies.

- **Actuarial Analyst – Sanlam Insurance**
  - Conducted thorough data cleaning and statistical analysis on financial data.
  - Created models for pricing, claim forecasting, and expense analysis.
  - Built interactive reports and dashboards in Power BI to drive business decision-making.

## Education

- **M.S. in Statistics** – *Oregon State University* *(2023 – 2024)*
- **B.S. in Mathematics** – *University of Ilorin, Nigeria* *(2014 – 2018)*

Currently, I am working on research in **feature selection methods for high-dimensional biomarker data**, leveraging LASSO and other machine learning techniques.

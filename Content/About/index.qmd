## About Me

I’m **Oluwaseun Daniel Fowotade**, a data scientist and statistical programmer with a passion for using data to answer meaningful questions in healthcare, biology, and beyond.

I bring over five years of experience in data analysis and more than two years in clinical trial programming, combining academic excellence with hands-on industry practice. I earned a **First Class B.Sc. in Mathematics** from the University of Ilorin (CGPA: 4.5/5.0) and currently hold a **First Class standing in my M.S. in Statistics** at Oregon State University (GPA: 3.71/4.0).

At the heart of my graduate work is a thesis project on developing an **ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers)** algorithm for analyzing **gut microbiome data** in multi-omic networks. This research blends structured optimization with statistical modeling to boost predictive performance, enhance scalability, and accelerate biomarker discovery.

In industry, I’ve contributed as a **Statistical Programmer at ClinFocus Inc.**, where I transformed raw clinical data into submission-ready SDTM and ADaM datasets, developed TFLs, and automated routine programming workflows in SAS. My work supported **Phase I–IV clinical trials** and met rigorous FDA and CDISC standards.

As a **Statistical Consultant at Oregon State**, I applied Poisson models, logistic regression (with LASSO), and Monte Carlo simulations to environmental and biological datasets. A highlight: I improved the AUROC of a genomic classifier by **70%** through regularized logistic regression.

Outside academic and clinical settings, I’ve tackled diverse technical projects—from building a **Shiny dashboard** to visualize Netflix trends, to performing **survival analysis** for liver disease outcomes in SAS, to **designing genetic algorithms in R** for dimensionality reduction in regression.

I’m also passionate about teaching. As a **Graduate Teaching Assistant**, I’ve led R-based workshops and supported students in statistics, data science, and SAS programming—emphasizing clarity, collaboration, and applied problem-solving.

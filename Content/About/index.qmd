## About Me

---

I’m **Oluwaseun Fowotade**, a passionate statistician and data scientist dedicated to uncovering meaningful insights from data. With over five years of experience in data analysis, statistical modeling, and clinical programming, I thrive in solving complex problems that drive decision-making.

I specialize in **healthcare analytics**, utilizing SAS, R, and Python to extract valuable insights from large datasets. My background includes survival analysis, predictive modeling, and developing scalable solutions for regulatory-compliant clinical research.

Beyond technical skills, I believe that data should tell a story—one that is clear, impactful, and actionable.

## Professional Experience

I’ve had the privilege of working in diverse roles that blend technical expertise with real-world applications:

- **Graduate Teaching Assistant – Oregon State University**  
  Teaching and mentoring students in R and SAS, with a focus on applied statistical techniques like regression modeling and survival analysis.

- **Statistical Programmer – ClinFocus Inc.**  
  Conducted **CDISC-compliant** programming for clinical trials, ensuring data integrity for FDA submissions.

- **Actuarial Analyst – Sanlam Insurance**  
  Designed risk models, optimized pricing strategies, and delivered data-driven insights for financial decision-making.

Each role has deepened my understanding of data science, from academic research to real-world healthcare applications.

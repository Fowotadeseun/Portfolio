## Introduction

Sex workers represent a critical population for targeted HIV prevention strategies. This project models the geographic and structural determinants of female sex worker (FSW) distribution across Sub-Saharan Africa using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs).

## Project Objectives

📊 Identify predictors of high FSW density using statistical modeling.

🌍 Understand regional disparities and implications for HIV transmission.

🔬 Inform strategic interventions and resource allocation using evidence-based methods.

---

## Key Results

- Urbanization, migration, and economic indicators are strong predictors of FSW distribution.
- GLMs helped reveal structural drivers behind observed geographic clustering.
- The model supports regional targeting for HIV-prevention programs.

---

## Implications

- This study provides a statistical framework to guide health intervention planning across SSA.
- Findings can assist NGOs, governments, and policymakers in focusing resources.

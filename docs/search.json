This dataset was originally studied by Gorman and Sejnowski in their research on classifying sonar signals with neural networks. The dataset consists of 208 observations, each representing a sonar signal, and 61 variables, including 60 numeric features and a categorical target variable, Class, which indicates whether the signal corresponds to a mine (“M”) or a rock (“R”).\nEach of the 60 features in the dataset represents the energy detected within a specific frequency band of the sonar signal. The values of these features are normalized to the range [0, 1]. These features are derived from the energy of sonar signals received after they bounce off either a mine or a rock. The Class variable is the target variable, with two possible values: “M” for mines and “R” for rocks.\nThe primary goal is to use these features to develop a model capable of distinguishing between the two classes based on the frequency patterns of the sonar signals."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Feature selection is a crucial step in building efficient machine learning models, especially in the context of regression. It involves selecting a subset of relevant features from a larger set, aiming to improve model performance, reduce overfitting, and increase interpretability. Traditional feature selection methods, such as backward elimination or stepwise regression, can struggle when dealing with high-dimensional or complex data. These methods may fail to capture nonlinear relationships between features and can be computationally expensive for large datasets.\nGenetic algorithms (GAs), inspired by the principles of natural selection, offer a promising approach to overcome these challenges. First proposed by John Holland in 1975, GAs are heuristic optimization techniques that simulate the process of natural evolution. In a GA, a population of candidate solutions evolves over generations using genetic operations like selection, crossover, and mutation.\nThis project applies GAs to feature selection in regression tasks, where the goal is to minimize prediction error and avoid overfitting. By leveraging the power of genetic evolution, the GA can efficiently explore large, high-dimensional spaces and identify the most relevant features for building robust predictive models."

If a dataset contains (C) features, the chromosome length is (C), and each gene corresponds to a specific feature.\nFor example: (1, 0, 1, 0, 1) Features 1, 3, and 5 selected, while 2 and 4 are excluded."

    "text": "Population Initialization\nThe algorithm starts by initializing a population of chromosomes randomly. The size of the population, (P), is critical as it influences the diversity of solutions. A larger population ensures more diversity, preventing premature convergence, while a smaller population might speed up the process but risk missing better solutions. Typically, the population size is chosen so that:\n[ C P 2C ]\nwhere (C) is the number of features."

    "text": "Selection\nThe selection step involves choosing individuals from the population based on their fitness to act as parents for the next generation. The fitness of a chromosome is determined by evaluating its associated feature subset in a regression model, typically using the mean squared error (MSE) as the performance metric. Tournament selection is often used, where a subset of chromosomes is randomly chosen, and the one with the best fitness is selected as a parent."

    "section": "Crossover and Mutation",
    "text": "Crossover and Mutation\nOnce parents are selected, they undergo genetic operations to create offspring. Crossover involves swapping parts of two parent chromosomes to produce offspring. A common method is single-point crossover, where a random crossover point is chosen, and the genes before and after this point are exchanged between the parents. Mutation introduces small random changes to maintain genetic diversity and avoid local optima. For instance, a mutation may flip the value of a random bit in the chromosome (e.g., changing 0 to 1 or vice versa). The mutation rate is usually kept low (e.g., 1% per generation) to ensure diversity without disrupting good solutions. ## Fitness Evaluation Each chromosome is evaluated using a regression model trained on the selected features. The fitness function is: \\[ Fitness(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 \\] where ( y_i ) are actual values and ( _i ) are predictions."

Over 89 iterations, the algorithm demonstrated consistent improvement in fitness, ultimately achieving a best fitness value of 0.3077. This fitness value, defined as (1 - ), indicates a corresponding predictive accuracy of 69.23% on the training set. The selected feature subset was designed to maximize classification performance while minimizing redundancy and over-fitting.\nThe GA selected the following features from the original set of 60 predictors:\nSelected features: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 24, 25, 28, 29, 30, 33, 37, 39, 41, 43, 47, 49, 51, 52, 58.\nThis reduced set of features was used to train a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier with (k = 3), selected based on a grid search for hyperparameter optimization. The training utilized 5-fold cross-validation to ensure model robustness and generalizability. On the test set, the following confusion matrix was obtained:\n\n\nCode\n# Create confusion matrix as a data frame\nconf_matrix &lt;- data.frame(\n  \"Actual\" = c(\"Actual M\", \"Actual R\"),\n  \"Predicted M\" = c(26, 7),\n  \"Predicted R\" = c(10, 19)\n)\n\n#kable to create a nicely formatted table\nknitr::kable(conf_matrix, caption = \"Confusion Matrix: Predicted vs Actual\", align = \"c\")\n\n\n\n\nTable: Confusion Matrix: Predicted vs Actual\n\n|  Actual  | Predicted.M | Predicted.R |\n|:--------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|\n| Actual M |     26      |     10      |\n| Actual R |      7      |     19      |\n\n\nFrom the confusion matrix, the following performance metrics were computed:\n\nAccuracy: 72.58%\nSensitivity (True Positive Rate for Mines): 78.79%\nSpecificity (True Negative Rate for Rocks): 65.52%\nKappa Statistic: 0.4458\nBalanced Accuracy: 72.15%\n\nThe k-NN classifier displayed a solid ability to correctly classify mines, as indicated by the relatively high sensitivity of 78.79%.

    "text": "Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a severe and chronic liver disease characterized by progressive bile duct destruction, which can lead to liver failure and life-threatening complications. The PBC3 dataset originates from a multi-center randomized clinical trial conducted across six European hospitals between January 1983 and January 1987. This trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Cyclosporin A (CyA) in improving outcomes for patients diagnosed with PBC. A total of 349 patients were randomized to either (CyA) (176 patients) or placebo (173 patients). Initially, the primary outcome was defined as survival time; however, due to the increased use of liver transplantation during the study, it was redefined as “failure of medical treatment,” encompassing death or liver transplantation. Patients were followed until January 1, 1989, or until one of three outcomes occurred: treatment failure, dropout, or the end of the study. By the end of the trial, 61 patients had died (CyA: 30, placebo: 31), 29 had undergone liver transplantation (CyA: 14, placebo: 15), and 4 were lost to follow-up. This analysis aims to evaluate the effect of (CyA) treatment on time to failure of medical treatment, while accounting for critical patient characteristics, such as (age), (sex), and clinical measures. The dataset includes both continuous variables, such as (crea), (alb), and (bili), and categorical variables, such as (tment), (sex), and (stage). Using survival analysis techniques, we will conduct descriptive analyses, univariate analyses using the Kaplan-Meier estimator, and regression modeling with Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) models. A critical aspect of this study is assessing potential limitations, including the multi-centre study design, which may introduce correlated observations within the same hospital. The assumptions of regression models will be carefully evaluated to ensure valid and reliable conclusions. Ultimately, this analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effect of treatment and patient characteristics on time to failure, informing clinical decision-making and optimizing treatment strategies for PBC.\n\n\nThe dataset summary in (Table 1) shows a diverse patient population. (Ages) ranged from 26 to 75 years, averaging 54.1 years. Key clinical markers varied widely: (creatinine levels) ranged from 35 to 199 (mean 78), (albumin) from 20.63 to 58 (mean 38.4), and bilirubin from 2.33 to 453.1 (mean 45.47). (Alkaline phosphatase) spanned 66.33 to 5108, with a mean of 996.5, and (aspartate transaminase) ranged from 10.5 to 316.3 (mean 95.4). (Patients) weighed between 38 and 98 kg (mean 60.3 kg), and (time to failure) ranged from 1 to 2146 days, with an average of 942.7 days. These variations reflect the differing severity of the condition and treatment outcomes in the study. The frequency analysis provides insights into the distribution of key categorical variables in the dataset. For the treatment variable (tment), 50.43% of patients were assigned to Cyclosporin A (CyA), while 49.57% received the placebo. The majority of patients were female (sex=0, 85.39%), with males making up 14.61% of the population. Regarding the disease stage (stage), 25.79% of patients were at stage 4, followed by 24.07% at stage 2, and 19.48% at stage 3, with 14.04% in stage 1. Notably, 16.62% of entries for this variable are missing. A history of gastrointestinal bleeding (gibleed) was reported for 14.33% of patients, with the remaining 85.67% having no such history. In terms of outcomes (status), 74.21% of patients were censored (no failure of medical treatment), 8.31% underwent liver transplantation, and 17.48% died during the study.\n\n\n\nThe visualizations reveal several important observations. The histogram (figure 1) of time to failure indicates a wide range of survival times, with a mean of approximately 942 days, though the distribution is not perfectly normal. The box plot (figure 4) comparing treatment types suggests that the median survival times are similar between the two groups, with no major differences in spread or outliers. Scatter plots (figure 2 and 3) of time to failure against age and weight show no clear linear relationships, indicating that these variables may not have strong individual effects on survival time. The scatter plots illustrate the relationship between time to failure (days) and key biochemical markers: creatinine (crea), albumin (alb), and bilirubin (bili). The plot of (days) against (crea)(figure 5) shows a scattered distribution without a clear trend, suggesting limited direct association between creatinine levels and survival time. In contrast, (alb) appears to have a positive association with (days) in (figure 6), as higher albumin levels generally correspond to longer survival times. For (bili) (figure 7), the plot indicates a potential negative relationship, with higher bilirubin levels often associated with shorter survival times. These observations highlight the differing impacts of biochemical markers on patient outcomes, warranting further investigation through multivariate analysis.\n\n\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed several key findings. For treatment groups (Figure 8), the survival curves for Cyclosporin A (CyA) and placebo showed overlapping confidence intervals, with a log-rank test p-value of 0.7813, indicating no statistically significant difference in survival probabilities between the two arms. Stratification by disease stage (Figure 9) demonstrated clear separation of survival curves, with advanced stages (Stage 4) associated with markedly lower survival probabilities compared to earlier stages. This was supported by a highly significant log-rank p-value ($&lt;$0.0001), underscoring the critical impact of disease stage on survival outcomes.\nFor sex (Figure 10), a significant difference was observed, with the log-rank test yielding a p-value of 0.0060, suggesting an association between sex and survival time. Patients without a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (gibleed = 0) exhibited higher survival probabilities compared to those with bleeding history (Figure 11), with a log-rank test p-value of $&lt;$0.05. Finally, survival probabilities varied significantly by patient exit status (Figure 12), where censoring, transplantation, and death showed distinct patterns, highlighting the need to accurately interpret censored observations in survival models. These results indicate that while treatment with (CyA) does not significantly improve survival outcomes, disease stage and gastrointestinal bleeding history are important prognostic factors. Additionally, the association between sex and survival time warrants further exploration to understand potential biological or demographic contributions to this disparity. Early identification and management of critical factors, such as advanced disease stages, remain essential in optimizing patient outcomes.\n\n\n\nThe Cox Proportional Hazards Model in (Table 2) was applied to evaluate the effect of treatment and other covariates on survival outcomes. The global test for the model was highly significant (( p &lt; 0.0001 )), indicating that the covariates collectively explained variations in survival. Among individual predictors, (sex), (bili), (alb), and (stage) were significant contributors. Males exhibited a significantly higher hazard compared to females (( HR = 2.59, p = 0.0015 )), while elevated (bili) (( HR = 1.009, p &lt; 0.0001 )) and lower (alb) levels (( HR = 0.936, p = 0.0071 )) were associated with poorer survival. Advanced disease stages, particularly (stage 4), were linked to higher risk of failure compared to (stage 2) (( HR = 2.11, p = 0.0409 )). Although (tment) (Cyclosporin A treatment) suggested a potential reduction in risk (( HR = 0.65 )), this effect was not statistically significant (( p = 0.0680 )). (age) and (crea) levels showed no significant association with survival, while (gibleed) and variability across (unit) (hospitals) also had no meaningful effect. These findings highlight key predictors of survival, with (sex), (bili), (alb), and (stage) emerging as significant factors, while the effect of (tment) warrants further investigation.\n\n\n\nThe proportional hazards assumption(Table 3) was evaluated for all variables in the Cox model using Schoenfeld residuals. Statistical tests and graphical diagnostics provided insights into the behavior of each covariate over time. For treatment (tment), the test statistic (( p = 0.3520 )) and the residual plot showed no discernible trend, indicating that the proportional hazards assumption is satisfied. Similarly, for sex (sex), the test yielded ( p = 0.7790 ), with residuals randomly distributed around zero, further supporting the assumption. (age), (bili), (alb), and (crea) also met the assumption, with ( p &gt; 0.05 ) in all cases and no systematic patterns observed in the residual plots. For the disease stage (stage), a significant violation was detected for (stage 1) (( p &lt; 0.0001 )), as evidenced by a clear departure from randomness in the residual plot. Other stages showed no significant issues (( p &gt; 0.05 )). Residuals for the hospital (unit) and gastrointestinal bleeding (gibleed) variables appeared random and within acceptable bounds, with ( p &gt; 0.05 ) in all cases, confirming that the proportional hazards assumption holds for these variables. Overall, the assumption of proportional hazards was satisfied for most covariates, except for (stage 1), where the violation suggests potential time-dependent effects. This could be addressed by stratifying the Cox model by (stage) or incorporating time-varying covariates to account for the non-proportionality. The residual plots and test results collectively provide confidence in the model’s robustness, with minor adjustments required to handle specific violations.\n\n\n\nThe Accelerated Failure Time model for all covariates is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log(\\text{days}) = \\beta_0 &+ \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{age} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{sex} + \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{tment} \\\\\n&+ \\beta_4 \\cdot \\text{stage} + \\beta_5 \\cdot \\text{crea} + \\beta_6 \\cdot \\text{alb} \\\\\n&+ \\beta_7 \\cdot \\text{bili} + \\beta_8 \\cdot \\text{alkph} + \\beta_9 \\cdot \\text{asptr} + \\beta_{10} \\cdot \\text{weight} + \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn this model, ((days)) represents the log-transformed survival time, and (_0) is the intercept term. The coefficients (_i) quantify the effect of covariates on survival, including (age) (patient age), (sex) (patient sex: 1 for male, 0 for female), (tment) (treatment group: 1 for CyA, 0 for placebo), (stage) (disease stage, reference = Stage 2), (crea) (creatinine levels), (alb) (albumin levels), (bili) (bilirubin levels), (alkph) (alkaline phosphatase levels), (asptr) (aspartate transaminase levels), and (weight) (patient weight). The term () represents the error term, which follows a Weibull distribution.\\\nThe Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model using the Weibull distribution revealed significant insights into the factors influencing survival time. The model converged successfully, with fit statistics (AIC = 375.539) indicating a reasonable fit to the data. The Weibull shape parameter (( = 1.6369 )) suggests an increasing hazard over time, consistent with the progressive nature of the disease. Among the covariates, treatment (tment) was significant (( = -0.3083, p = 0.0294 )), indicating that CyA treatment accelerates survival time compared to placebo. Sex (sex) also showed a significant effect (( = 0.7787, p = 0.0001 )), with males experiencing longer survival times. Bilirubin (bili, ( = -0.0051, p &lt; 0.0001 )) and albumin (alb, ( = 0.0390, p = 0.0086 )) were significant predictors, where higher bilirubin reduced survival time and higher albumin extended it. Elevated aspartate transaminase (asptr, ( = -0.0029, p = 0.0341 )) also decreased survival. Other covariates, such as (age), (crea), (alkph), (stage), and (weight), were not significant predictors (( p &gt; 0.05 )). Diagnostic checks, including negative log-log survival plots and Cox-Snell residuals, support the adequacy of the Weibull model. The linear pattern in the negative log-log plot validates the Weibull assumption, and the residuals showed no major violations, confirming the robustness of the model for this analysis.\n\n\nThe Accelerated Failure Time model with significant covariates is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log(\\text{days}) = \\beta_0 &+ \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{sex} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{tment} + \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{alb} \\\\\n&+ \\beta_4 \\cdot \\text{bili} + \\beta_5 \\cdot \\text{asptr} + \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn this model, ((days)) represents the log-transformed survival time, and (_0) is the intercept term. The coefficients (_i) quantify the effect of the significant covariates, including (sex) (patient sex: 1 for male, 0 for female), (tment) (treatment group: 1 for CyA, 0 for placebo), (alb) (albumin levels), (bili) (bilirubin levels), and (asptr) (aspartate transaminase levels). The term () represents the error term, which follows a Weibull distribution.\n\n\n\nThe diagnostic evaluation of the Weibull AFT model using negative log-log (NLL) survival plots above suggests that the Weibull assumption is largely appropriate for the data. The NLL plot exhibits a reasonably linear pattern, indicating that the hazard function aligns well with the Weibull distribution’s characteristics. While some deviations are observed in specific segments, these appear minor and do not significantly compromise the model’s fit. The overall consistency of the linear trend across most of the range provides confidence in the adequacy of the Weibull model. Additionally, the residual diagnostics further support the model’s validity. The Cox-Snell residuals align well with the 45-degree reference line, demonstrating that the observed data conform to the expected survival distribution. Standardized residuals display a random scatter around zero without extreme outliers, suggesting that the model captures the underlying data patterns effectively and that no major violations of model assumptions are present. These diagnostics collectively affirm the robustness and suitability of the Weibull model for analyzing the given survival data.\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis of the PBC3 dataset provided key insights into the survival outcomes of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) based on treatment with Cyclosporin A (CyA) and other covariates. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no statistically significant improvement in survival for patients treated with (CyA) compared to placebo (( p = 0.7813 )). However, significant survival differences were observed based on disease stage, sex, and gastrointestinal bleeding history. The Cox Proportional Hazards model confirmed these findings, identifying (sex), (bili), (alb), and (stage) as significant predictors of survival, while (tment) had a non-significant effect. Advanced disease stages and higher bilirubin levels were associated with poorer survival outcomes, while higher albumin levels were protective.\nThe Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model using the Weibull distribution provided additional insights, confirming the significance of (sex), (tment), (alb), (bili), and (asptr). Diagnostic checks, including Cox-Snell residuals and standardized residuals, validated the adequacy of the Weibull model, with no severe violations observed. Negative log-log survival plots further supported the appropriateness of the Weibull assumption, showing a largely linear pattern with only minor deviations.\n\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier estimator provided a simple and intuitive method for comparing survival probabilities across groups, but it could not account for multiple covariates simultaneously. The Cox model allowed for the inclusion of multiple covariates, providing hazard ratios that quantify the effect of predictors on survival. However, the violation of the proportional hazards assumption for (stage 1) indicated that the Cox model may not fully capture time-dependent effects. The AFT model, on the other hand, directly modeled survival time and performed well with the Weibull distribution, offering a robust alternative when the proportional hazards assumption was in question.\n\n\n\nWhile most assumptions were satisfied, the violation of proportional hazards for (stage 1) in the Cox model suggests the need for refinements, such as stratification or the inclusion of time-dependent covariates. These limitations highlight the importance of verifying assumptions to ensure model validity. The AFT model assumptions were well-supported by residual diagnostics, affirming the suitability of the Weibull distribution.\n\n\n\nFurther analyses could explore alternative parametric distributions for the AFT model or stratified Cox models to address the violation of assumptions for (stage 1). Interaction terms between covariates, such as between (tment) and (stage), could provide additional insights into the effect of treatment across different stages of the disease. Additionally, incorporating time-dependent covariates in the Cox model could address non-proportional hazards and improve model accuracy.\nThis comprehensive analysis underscores the complexity of survival outcomes in PBC and highlights the importance of leveraging multiple analytical methods to derive robust conclusions."

    "text": "Discussion/Conclusion\nThe analysis of the PBC3 dataset provided key insights into the survival outcomes of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) based on treatment with Cyclosporin A (CyA) and other covariates. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no statistically significant improvement in survival for patients treated with (CyA) compared to placebo (( p = 0.7813 )). However, significant survival differences were observed based on disease stage, sex, and gastrointestinal bleeding history. The Cox Proportional Hazards model confirmed these findings, identifying (sex), (bili), (alb), and (stage) as significant predictors of survival, while (tment) had a non-significant effect. Advanced disease stages and higher bilirubin levels were associated with poorer survival outcomes, while higher albumin levels were protective.\nThe Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model using the Weibull distribution provided additional insights, confirming the significance of (sex), (tment), (alb), (bili), and (asptr). Diagnostic checks, including Cox-Snell residuals and standardized residuals, validated the adequacy of the Weibull model, with no severe violations observed. Negative log-log survival plots further supported the appropriateness of the Weibull assumption, showing a largely linear pattern with only minor deviations.\n\nPros and Cons of the Methods\nThe Kaplan-Meier estimator provided a simple and intuitive method for comparing survival probabilities across groups, but it could not account for multiple covariates simultaneously. The Cox model allowed for the inclusion of multiple covariates, providing hazard ratios that quantify the effect of predictors on survival. However, the violation of the proportional hazards assumption for (stage 1) indicated that the Cox model may not fully capture time-dependent effects. The AFT model, on the other hand, directly modeled survival time and performed well with the Weibull distribution, offering a robust alternative when the proportional hazards assumption was in question.\n\n\nModel Assumptions\nWhile most assumptions were satisfied, the violation of proportional hazards for (stage 1) in the Cox model suggests the need for refinements, such as stratification or the inclusion of time-dependent covariates. These limitations highlight the importance of verifying assumptions to ensure model validity. The AFT model assumptions were well-supported by residual diagnostics, affirming the suitability of the Weibull distribution.\n\n\nFuture Directions\nFurther analyses could explore alternative parametric distributions for the AFT model or stratified Cox models to address the violation of assumptions for (stage 1). Interaction terms between covariates, such as between (tment) and (stage), could provide additional insights into the effect of treatment across different stages of the disease. Additionally, incorporating time-dependent covariates in the Cox model could address non-proportional hazards and improve model accuracy.\nThis comprehensive analysis underscores the complexity of survival outcomes in PBC and highlights the importance of leveraging multiple analytical methods to derive robust conclusions."

The coefficients (_i) quantify the effect of covariates on survival, including (age) (patient age), (sex) (patient sex: 1 for male, 0 for female), (tment) (treatment group: 1 for CyA, 0 for placebo), (stage) (disease stage, reference = Stage 2), (crea) (creatinine levels), (alb) (albumin levels), (bili) (bilirubin levels), (alkph) (alkaline phosphatase levels), (asptr) (aspartate transaminase levels), and (weight) (patient weight). The term () represents the error term, which follows a Weibull distribution.\\\nThe Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model using the Weibull distribution revealed significant insights into the factors influencing survival time. The model converged successfully, with fit statistics (AIC = 375.539) indicating a reasonable fit to the data. The Weibull shape parameter (( = 1.6369 )) suggests an increasing hazard over time, consistent with the progressive nature of the disease. Among the covariates, treatment (tment) was significant (( = -0.3083, p = 0.0294 )), indicating that CyA treatment accelerates survival time compared to placebo. Sex (sex) also showed a significant effect (( = 0.7787, p = 0.0001 )), with males experiencing longer survival times. Bilirubin (bili, ( = -0.0051, p &lt; 0.0001 )) and albumin (alb, ( = 0.0390, p = 0.0086 )) were significant predictors, where higher bilirubin reduced survival time and higher albumin extended it. Elevated aspartate transaminase (asptr, ( = -0.0029, p = 0.0341 )) also decreased survival. Other covariates, such as (age), (crea), (alkph), (stage), and (weight), were not significant predictors (( p &gt; 0.05 )). Diagnostic checks, including negative log-log survival plots and Cox-Snell residuals, support the adequacy of the Weibull model. The linear pattern in the negative log-log plot validates the Weibull assumption, and the residuals showed no major violations, confirming the robustness of the model for this analysis.\n\nSignificant Weibull AFT Model\nThe Accelerated Failure Time model with significant covariates is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log(\\text{days}) = \\beta_0 &+ \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{sex} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{tment} + \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{alb} \\\\\n&+ \\beta_4 \\cdot \\text{bili} + \\beta_5 \\cdot \\text{asptr} + \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn this model, ((days)) represents the log-transformed survival time, and (_0) is the intercept term.

The term () represents the error term, which follows a Weibull distribution.\n\n\nAssumption Check for Weibull Regression\nThe diagnostic evaluation of the Weibull AFT model using negative log-log (NLL) survival plots above suggests that the Weibull assumption is largely appropriate for the data. The NLL plot exhibits a reasonably linear pattern, indicating that the hazard function aligns well with the Weibull distribution’s characteristics. While some deviations are observed in specific segments, these appear minor and do not significantly compromise the model’s fit. The overall consistency of the linear trend across most of the range provides confidence in the adequacy of the Weibull model. Additionally, the residual diagnostics further support the model’s validity. The Cox-Snell residuals align well with the 45-degree reference line, demonstrating that the observed data conform to the expected survival distribution. Standardized residuals display a random scatter around zero without extreme outliers, suggesting that the model captures the underlying data patterns effectively and that no major violations of model assumptions are present. These diagnostics collectively affirm the robustness and suitability of the Weibull model for analyzing the given survival data."

    "text": "Kaplan-Meier Analysis\nThe Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed several key findings. For treatment groups (Figure 8), the survival curves for Cyclosporin A (CyA) and placebo showed overlapping confidence intervals, with a log-rank test p-value of 0.7813, indicating no statistically significant difference in survival probabilities between the two arms. Stratification by disease stage (Figure 9) demonstrated clear separation of survival curves, with advanced stages (Stage 4) associated with markedly lower survival probabilities compared to earlier stages. This was supported by a highly significant log-rank p-value ($&lt;$0.0001), underscoring the critical impact of disease stage on survival outcomes.\nFor sex (Figure 10), a significant difference was observed, with the log-rank test yielding a p-value of 0.0060, suggesting an association between sex and survival time. Patients without a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (gibleed = 0) exhibited higher survival probabilities compared to those with bleeding history (Figure 11), with a log-rank test p-value of $&lt;$0.05. Finally, survival probabilities varied significantly by patient exit status (Figure 12), where censoring, transplantation, and death showed distinct patterns, highlighting the need to accurately interpret censored observations in survival models. These results indicate that while treatment with (CyA) does not significantly improve survival outcomes, disease stage and gastrointestinal bleeding history are important prognostic factors. Additionally, the association between sex and survival time warrants further exploration to understand potential biological or demographic contributions to this disparity. Early identification and management of critical factors, such as advanced disease stages, remain essential in optimizing patient outcomes."

The cohort was predominantly female (85.39%), while males accounted for 14.61%. Disease stage distribution varied, with 14.04% in Stage 1, 24.07% in Stage 2, 19.48% in Stage 3, and 25.79% in Stage 4, while 16.62% of entries had missing data. A history of gastrointestinal bleeding (gibleed) was reported in 14.33% of cases, whereas 85.67% had no reported history. In terms of outcomes (status), 74.21% were censored (no treatment failure), 8.31% underwent liver transplantation, and 17.48% resulted in death. # Data Visualization\nThe visualizations reveal several important observations. The histogram (figure 1) of time to failure indicates a wide range of survival times, with a mean of approximately 942 days, though the distribution is not perfectly normal.\nThe box plot (figure 4) comparing treatment types suggests that the median survival times are similar between the two groups, with no major differences in spread or outliers. Scatter plots (figure 2 and 3) of time to failure against age and weight show no clear linear relationships, indicating that these variables may not have strong individual effects on survival time. The scatter plots illustrate the relationship between time to failure (days) and key biochemical markers: creatinine (crea), albumin (alb), and bilirubin (bili). The plot of (days) against (crea)(figure 5) shows a scattered distribution without a clear trend, suggesting limited direct association between creatinine levels and survival time. In contrast, (alb) appears to have a positive association with (days) in (figure 6), as higher albumin levels generally correspond to longer survival times. For (bili) (figure 7), the plot indicates a potential negative relationship, with higher bilirubin levels often associated with shorter survival times. These observations highlight the differing impacts of biochemical markers on patient outcomes, warranting further investigation through multivariate analysis."
